# Regression Discontinuity Designs

Software packages for analysis and interpretation of regression discontinuity designs and related methods. Replication files and illustration code employing these packages are also available. 

This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation through grants [SES-1357561](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1357561), [SES-1459931](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1459931), [SES-1459967](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1459967), [SES-1947662](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1947662), [SES-1947805](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1947805), and [SES-2019432](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2019432).
