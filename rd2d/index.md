# RD2D

The `rd2d` package provides R implementations of pointwise and uniform estimation and inference for Boundary Discontinuity Designs employing local polynomial methods.

This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation through grants [SES-2019432](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2019432) and [SES-2241575](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2241575).
